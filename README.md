- ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I am **Erdem**. I am a non-stop learner. After I have studied Econometrics for 3 years,  I wanted to pursue a more challenging career in 2015. I got into **Management Information Systems** degree and graduated in 2020. Programming, software, briefly every kind of technology is my passion. I love to be able to work in this career field.
- I have been trying many different areas in software development including iOS, Web Development, etc. Nowadays I don't choose either of them, I just do the projects in the language I want!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Node.JS and React.
